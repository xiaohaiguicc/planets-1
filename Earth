Earth has the moon - quote of the day: 
    We're whalers on the moon,
    We carry a harpoon.
    But there ain't no whales
    So we tell tall tales
    And sing our whaling tune.
Not sure what this riddle is about. 
Blue moon, white whale, Moby Dick...

climate change is real !!!!
Whalers: reminds me of gambling

Three mathematicians walk into a restaurant. The waitress asks them "Do you all want a drink?"
The first mathematician thinks for a second, and says, "I don't know".
The second mathematician thinks for a second, and says, "I don't know".
The third mathematician thinks for a second, and says, "Yes".


This currently seems to be the only planet where humans
live. Perhaps Elon Musk will change that.
I like it
